# PHP User Password Basics

[Cette page en fran√ßais.](LISEZMOI.md)

This project is a working base for any web developer working in PHP and having to implement a user account.

I voluntarily don't integrate the two-factor authentication (2FA) and the different techniques around it, but if you want to do things properly it is highly recommended on all sites.

## Install

To download this project you better should use "git" command but you also can download a ZIP from [its GitHub repository](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/PHP-UserPassword-Basics).

**Warning :** if the project has submodules dependencies they wont be in the ZIP file. You'll have to download them manually.

A database SQL file contains the description of the "users" table used by PHP programs. You need to add it to your database and configure the program settings in the ./src/protected/config-dist.inc.php file by copying it as explained in it.
